## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or above recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/sunil0336/HospitalMealManagement.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm:

cd HospitalMealManagement/Backend
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Backend Server

Once all dependencies are installed, you can start the Backend server by running the following command:

By default, the server will start on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```
PORT=3000
DB_URI=mongodb://your-db-uri

## Start the Frontend with Live Server

- Open the frontend files (HTML) in your vscode
  
- Install the **Live Server** extension in VS Code if you haven't already.
  
- Right-click on your `index.html` file (or any entry HTML file) and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
  
  This will start a local server for your frontend at [http://127.0.0.1:5500](http://127.0.0.1:5500) (or another port depending on your configuration).

- You can now view the frontend in your browser and make changes to the HTML, CSS, and JS files. The browser will auto-refresh to show any updates you make.
